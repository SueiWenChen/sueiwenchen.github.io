# Thesis
My undergraduate thesis concerns Markov chains and mixing times in relation to functional inequalities. Please see [here](/files/CapstoneProject_MarkovChainsMixingTimesAndFunctionalInequalities.pdf) for a long version and [here](/files/AFuzzyDecompositionMethodToEstablishFunctionalInequalities.pdf) for a short version.
