I am currently a research assistant at New York University Abu Dhabi under Prof. Pierre Youssef, studying the mathematical foundation of machine learning and data science. My research interest concerns the mathematical foundation of data science in the probabilistic aspect, including reinforcement learning and providing theoretical guarantees for machine learning algorithms.

I completed my undergraduate degree in 2023 at NYU Abu Dhabi with a major in mathematics and a minor in computer science. Starting from September 2024, I will be joining the master's program in data science at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
